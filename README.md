## Contribute!

Add your project:

1. Add your project's `name` and the `URL` of its GitHub repository, Trello group, Google Doc, wherever your latest updates are publicly available. Use Markdown format for links, like `[Project Name](https://github.com/your-repo-here)`
2. Add a `type`: Is it a static app, where the data does not change, or does the app store data and the data change dynamically? Is it a tool like an API or scraper? Is it a data set? Is it a mobile app or desktop app or both?
3. Add a contact place or person, like an `@`name for someone's name on Slack or `#`name for a channel group on Slack.
4. Add a `status`. Suggestions: `brainstorming`, `organizing`, `wireframing`, `getting data`, `cleaning data`, `testing`, `working on front-end`, `working on back-end`, `testing`
